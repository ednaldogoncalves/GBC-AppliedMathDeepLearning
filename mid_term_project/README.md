# Mid-Term Project: Image Classification Using CNN

## Overview
In this exercise, you will learn to use image dataset for classification.

## Objectives
- Build image classification CNN using python on the ImageNet datasets.
- CNNs work for the image classification task
- Using TensorFlow’s Keras library to demonstrate image classification using CNNs

## Dataset

There are various datasets that you can leverage for applying convolutional neural networks. Here are three popular datasets:

- MNIST
- CIFAR-10
- ImageNet

## Libraries

The algorithm described in Python 3.11.6 will be implemented, using the Keras library (on top of the TensorFlow libraries, which works as a backend). Allows the use of a GPU, if present, to accelerate the computation, which is recommended in the case of this type of networks, since their training is computationally heavy.

## Download the Imagenette dataset

Once you have downloaded the dataset, you will notice that it has two folders – “train” and “val”. These contain the training and validation set, respectively. Inside each folder, there are separate folders for each class.
